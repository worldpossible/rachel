What Countries have RACHEL deployments?
---------------------------------------

World Possible has shipped over 5,000 RACHEL devices to over 60 countries. The only information we have about those devices is the original location we shipped them to and we do not share that information (we are in fact prohibited by data-protection laws from providing that information).

We do not ask for any contact information on deployment partners and we do not wish to try to match individuals with past purchasers of the device. We do however strongly encourage users of RACHEL to make themselves known on our community forums at https://community.worldpossible.org

If you purchase RACHEL and do not post on the forums, we assume that you do not want us to provide your information to other potential RACHEL users. Similarly, if you ask us to introduce you to a RACHEL user in an area, our only guidance will be to check our user forums at https://community.worldpossible.org

World Possible recently developed and is piloting a tool called DataPost, which will allow anyone near a RACHEL to bring usage data back to the internet and our servers, but this tool is not yet widespread and will only be available on RACHEL devices shipped since June 2021.

Some RACHEL deployment partners have distributed over 150 RACHEL devices to schools or other locations. Individuals who have done so, are invited to apply to become a World Possible chapter.  You can reach our existing chapters here:

Guatemala - romeo@worldpossible.org

Ghana - mustapha@worldpossible.org

Sierra Leone - samuel@worldpossible.org

Tanzania - jackline@worldpossible.org

Kenya - bonface@worldpossible.org
