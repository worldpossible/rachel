Learning Management Systems
===========================

RACHEL comes with multiple Learning Management Systems installed to give you the choice of how you want to provide lessons to your students. 

Kolibri
-------

Kolibri is a Learning Management System provided by Learning Equality ( https://learningequality.org/ ). Through the installation of Kolibri channels, Kolibri provides even more ways to access and manage content such as Khan Academy on RACHEL-Plus devices. Teachers and administrators can create and manage lessons, as well as their own channels using Kolibri Studio ( studio.learningequality.org ).
