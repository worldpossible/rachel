Installing Modules from Zip Files
=================================

.. note::

    RACHEL Zip Module Files can be found on the [RACHEL Website](https://rachel.worldpossible.org/). This is a great resource because modules can be downloaded from the internet and then stored on USB devices to be installed in areas or places that don't have access to the internet*

1. Connect to RACHEL as Admin
2. Click on the "Settings" Tab

.. image:: ../_resources/03_ImportModulesSettings-1.jpg
