5.	You can now deliver these mail bundles back to the original RACHEL-Plus device!

.. important::
    PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD DATA IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO DELIVER IT TO THE CORRECT RACHEL. DATA WILL BE LOST AND WILL NOT DELIVER TO THE WRONG RACHEL.
    
    Please note: When using the DataPost app to pick up a bundle of e-mails from the internet destined for RACHEL, the android phone user must first have picked up a bundle from RACHEL and delivered it to the Internet. This process ensures the android phone user at one point had physical access to the RACHEL device and can be trusted to carry e-mails.

DataPost will also upload usage data from your RACHEL device to a website where anyone can view key anonymous usage statistics from your device
