DataPost
========

In 2021 World Possible released DataPost as a quick and easy way to get information to and from your RACHEL device without needing to put RACHEL on the internet. Anyone traveling to your RACHEL device with an Android Phone can serve as a digital mail courier, bringing new e-mails to RACHEL and picking up outgoing e-mails from the device. Included automatically in outgoing emails are usage logs of your RACHEL device that send to World Possible so we can analyze and display usage data.

These Guides will help you learn to install and use the DataPost Application.
